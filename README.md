## What this is
These are the default project templates for the Crumbl2D Editor. You can find the entire [Crumbl2D Editor](https://github.com/Crumbl-Studios/CrumblEngine) with source code here. This is the repository Crumbl2D will download from when downloading templates.
## Installation
Crumbl2D's editor is nowhere close to being finished. These instructions will change over the course of the project.

- Choose an install file pack and click Open
- Sit back, relax, let it install (depending on size this may take a while)
- After it installs, you will see a message asking if you would like to remove the pack files after it is finished
### Installation for future versions
- Choose the version of [Crumbl2D](https://github.com/Crumbl-Studios/CrumblEngine) that is availiable for your OS, which will download an installer.
- Simply run the installer. This will install all related files and will do all processes for you.
