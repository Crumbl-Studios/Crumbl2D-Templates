## What this is
These are the default project templates for the Crumbl Engine Editor. You can find the entire [Crumbl Engine Editor](https://github.com/Crumbl-Studios/CrumblEngine) with source code here. This is the repository Crumbl Engine will download from when downloading templates.
## Installation
Crumbl Engine's editor is nowhere close to being finished. These instructions will change over the course of the project.

### Installation for future versions

- Simply run the installer. This will install all related files and will do all processes for you.
